# 🐍 the_snake Game  

This is my implementation of the classic **Snake Game** in **Python** using **Pygame**.  
I built this project to practice game development, Python logic, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  

The gameplay is simple: I control the snake, eat apples to grow, and try to avoid colliding with the snake’s own body.  
If the snake runs into itself — the game restarts.  

## 🎮 Features I implemented  
- Four-directional movement (up, down, left, right)  
- Infinite field: the snake wraps around the screen edges  
- Random apple generation  
- Snake grows when eating an apple  
- Object-Oriented Design with key classes:  
  - `GameObject` — the base for all game objects  
  - `Snake` — controls movement, growth, and collisions  
  - `Apple` — generates apples at random positions  

## 🚀 How to run the game  
```bash
python snake.py
