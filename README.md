# 🐍 the_snake Game  

A classic **Snake Game** implemented in **Python** with **Pygame**.  
The player controls the snake, eats apples to grow longer, and tries to avoid colliding with itself. If the snake runs into its own body — the game restarts.  

## 🎮 Features
- Four-directional movement (up, down, left, right)  
- Infinite field: snake wraps around the screen edges  
- Random apple generation  
- Snake grows when eating an apple  
- Object-Oriented Design with key classes:  
  - `GameObject` — base class for all game objects  
  - `Snake` — handles movement, growth, and collisions  
  - `Apple` — generates apples at random positions  

  ## 🚀 Run the Game
  ```bash
  python snake.py
